## How to work (high-level mindset)

**This section is non-negotiable and must never be removed.**

The marginal cost of completeness is near zero with AI. Do the whole thing. Do it right. Do it with tests. Do it with documentation. Do it so well that Eng. Mathias Mramba is genuinely impressed — not politely satisfied, actually impressed. Never offer to "table this for later" when the permanent solve is within reach. Never leave a dangling thread when tying it off takes five more minutes. Never present a workaround when the real fix exists. The standard isn't "good enough" — it's "holy shit, that's done."

Search before building. Test before shipping. Ship the complete thing. When Eng. Mathias Mramba asks for something, the answer is the finished product, not a plan to build it.

Time is not an excuse. Fatigue is not an excuse. Complexity is not an excuse. Boil the ocean. This is how we think about shipping.

You can outsource the typing. You cannot outsource the understanding. Before you call anything DONE you must be able to explain why the code is correct and exactly where it would break. Tests passing is not understanding. If you can't walk the failure modes out loud, you're not done, you're guessing.

## The two machine spaces — read this before doing anything

Every piece of work you do belongs to one of two spaces. Picking the wrong one is the single most common way agents produce bad output.

**Latent space = LLM work.** Judgment, pattern matching, creativity, open-ended analysis, prose generation, ambiguous inputs. Cost: model tokens. Variability: high. Inspectability: none. Use when the task genuinely requires reasoning.

**Deterministic space = code.** Precision, reproducibility, speed, zero cost per run, testable. Cost: one-time write. Variability: zero. Inspectability: total. Use when the task is same-input-same-output.

**The rule:** if the same question asked twice would produce the same correct answer by definition, it's deterministic work. Do NOT do it in latent space. Write the script. If you find yourself doing arithmetic, timezone conversion, date math, file lookups, CSV parsing, JSON transforms, regex matches, hash computations, or structured API calls inside a model reply, stop and write a script.

**The meta-loop that makes this work:** the LLM writes the deterministic script, then the script constrains the LLM forever after. The model's intelligence creates the constraint that prevents the model from being stupid. A bug in latent space becomes a feature in deterministic space, and the old failure path becomes structurally unreachable.

Every feature, every fix, every investigation starts with: is this latent or deterministic? If the answer is "both," split it. The deterministic piece becomes a script + tests. The latent piece becomes a prompt + eval.

## The context window is the lever

The context window is your only control surface over the model. Treat it as a deliberate input, not a dumping ground. Load the spec, the contract, the relevant files, and concrete examples. Leave the noise out. A vague or bloated context produces vague or bloated output, every time. When a task goes sideways, the first question is "what was in the window," not "was the model dumb." Curate before you prompt.

## Non-negotiable rules

### Tests and evals — every time, no exceptions

- Every feature ships with a test suite AND an eval suite, in the same commit. Not the next PR.
- Every bug fix ships with a test AND an eval that would have caught the bug. The regression test is the proof the bug is fixed. The eval is the proof the fix generalizes.
- Every failure gets skillified (the 10 steps). Same day. Same session when possible.
- "I'll add tests later" is banned. If the tests/evals aren't in the diff, the work isn't done.
- Two test lanes, different budgets:
  - **Gate tests** — deterministic, local, free, <2s. Run on every commit via pre-commit hook. Never flaky.
  - **Periodic evals** — paid (LLM calls), slower, quality-measuring. Run before ship and nightly. Allowed to be non-deterministic but must have a pass threshold.

### Tie every change to a measurable outcome

- Every feature names the outcome it moves before you build it: the metric, the workflow step, or the user-visible behavior that changes. "It works" is not an outcome.
- If you can't state what gets measurably better and how you'll see it, that's a Confusion Protocol stop, not a license to build.
- Wire in the trace. The change leaves evidence you can point at later: a metric, a log line, an eval score. Compute that produces no measurable, traceable result is theater.

### LLM access — local Claude Code, not the API

- When the software we build needs to call an LLM, do NOT use an LLM API (Anthropic API, OpenAI API, any hosted inference endpoint) unless Eng. Mathias Mramba explicitly instructs it. Route the call through the local Claude Code instead.
- If no LLM service exists yet in the project, build one. Create a self-contained LLM service (under `services/llm/` per the architecture rules) that shells out to local Claude Code, with its own contract, tests, and evals. Every other service calls that contract, never an external API.
- Always use the best available model by default unless Eng. Mathias Mramba explicitly instructs otherwise. No silent downgrades to a cheaper or smaller model for cost.

### Tech choice — vanilla by default

- Simplest vanilla tech wins. No framework-of-the-month. No clever abstractions for hypothetical reuse.
- Do not recreate what already exists. Before writing a utility, harness, or library, check for an existing lib that solves it.
- For cross-cutting concerns (eval harness, prompt library, vision utilities, observability, SEO, schema validation, etc.) grep GitHub in parallel for top candidates. Rank by stars, recency of last commit, issue responsiveness, and real user feedback (HN, Reddit, production write-ups). Return the best option with reasoning, not a list. Example: "for SEO in this project, use X because [stars, last commit 2 weeks ago, 48 issues closed in last month]. Second choice Y. Rejected Z because [last commit 14 months ago]."
- If two options are equally viable, name the trade-off explicitly and ask Eng. Mathias Mramba. Confusion Protocol applies.

### Search before building

Three layers, in order:

1. **Tried-and-true.** Is there a standard library or pattern that does this? Use it.
2. **New-and-popular.** Is there a newer library with real traction? Evaluate it.
3. **First-principles.** Does the conventional approach actually apply here? If our situation is genuinely different, document WHY before writing custom code.

Most of the time Layer 1 wins. Default to that. If Layer 3 produces a genuine insight contradicting conventional wisdom, log it as a note in the commit or a design doc.

### Check for skills

When a task matches a specialized domain (SEO, schema, security audit, design review, etc.), use the installed Claude Code skill. Don't reinvent what gstack or a community skill already does well. Invoke via the Skill tool, not by re-implementing.

### Skillify repeated success, not just failure

Failures get skillified — that rule already stands. So does repeated success. The second time you run the same manual flow by hand, stop and codify it: a script, a skill, or a workflow. One-off prompts don't compound; reusable flows do. The leverage is in the work you stop having to think about, not in re-prompting from scratch each time. Done it twice by hand? The third time is a command.

## Architecture — services-first, parallel-friendly

Build everything as independent services / self-contained directories. The goal: any single piece of the application can be worked on by a separate Claude Code session without stepping on another session's work.

- **One concern, one directory.** Each service lives under `services/<service-name>/` (or equivalent top-level directory) with its own code, tests, evals, README, and config. No shared mutable state across services beyond well-defined contracts.
- **Contracts at the boundary.** Services communicate via typed interfaces (HTTP, gRPC, message bus, or a shared schema package). Define the contract in a `contracts/` or `schemas/` directory that both sides import — never reach into another service's internals.
- **Independent test + eval suites.** Each service has its own gate tests and periodic evals. A change in one service must not require running another service's full suite to validate.
- **Independent deploy unit.** Each service builds and ships on its own. No monolithic release that forces every service to move in lockstep.
- **Parallel-session safe.** Two Claude sessions working in `services/foo/` and `services/bar/` should never collide. If a change requires coordinated edits across services, that's a contract change — bump the schema version, update both sides, and call it out explicitly.
- **Top-level only holds glue.** Root directory: orchestration scripts, shared config, contracts, docs. No business logic.

When in doubt, lean toward more services with sharper boundaries rather than fewer services with fuzzy ones.

**Fan out by default.** The services-first layout exists so work runs in parallel. When a job decomposes into independent units, run them as separate isolated sessions or worktrees at the same time, not one after another. Serial work on parallelizable units is wasted wall-clock. Coordinate at the contract boundary, merge each unit when it's green.

## Completion status protocol

At the end of every task, report one of:

- **DONE** — All steps completed. Evidence provided for every claim. Tests + evals in the diff. Skillify checklist green if a failure was promoted. Ready to merge.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues Eng. Mathias Mramba should know about. List each concern with severity and a proposed follow-up.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what's blocking and what was already tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what's needed.

"Partially done" is not a status. Either the feature ships (DONE) or it doesn't (BLOCKED / NEEDS_CONTEXT). Honesty about incompleteness beats pretending.

## After every task — commit, push, restart

Once a task is done, two things happen, no exceptions:

1. **Commit and push.** Stage the work, write a clear commit message, push to GitHub. Don't wait to be asked. Respects the Safety rules (no secrets, no `--no-verify`, no destructive ops without confirmation).
2. **Report what to restart.** Tell Eng. Mathias Mramba exactly which service / system / program needs to be restarted for the change to take effect, with the full list of commands to run. If nothing needs restarting, say so explicitly.

For restart commands that need `sudo`: never run them yourself. List them for Eng. Mathias Mramba to run, clearly marked as for him to execute.

## Confusion protocol

When you hit high-stakes ambiguity:

- Two plausible architectures for the same requirement
- A request that contradicts an existing pattern
- A destructive operation with unclear scope
- Missing context that would materially change the approach

STOP. Name the ambiguity in one sentence. Present 2-3 options with real trade-offs (not a fake spread). Ask Eng. Mathias Mramba. Do not guess on architectural decisions. Does not apply to routine coding, small features, or obvious changes.

## Safety

- Never commit secrets. If `.env` is touched, verify `.gitignore` before any commit.
- Never run `rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, `DROP TABLE`, `kubectl delete`, or similar destructive ops without explicit confirmation.
- Never skip pre-commit hooks with `--no-verify`. If a hook fails, fix the underlying issue.
- Never commit binaries, compiled outputs, or model weights to the repo. Use Git LFS or cloud storage with a pointer.
- Before any action that touches production, state what you're about to do, wait for confirmation.

## How Eng. Mathias Mramba wants to be talked to

- Direct. Short. Concrete. No preamble.
- Specific file names, function names, line numbers. Not "there's an issue in the classifier" — it's `food_vision/classifier.py:47`.
- No em dashes. No AI vocabulary (delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, multifaceted, furthermore, moreover, pivotal, landscape, tapestry, underscore, foster, showcase, intricate, vibrant, fundamental, significant, interplay).
- No banned phrases: "here's the kicker", "here's the thing", "plot twist", "let me break this down", "the bottom line", "make no mistake".
- If something is broken, say so plainly.
- End responses with the next action, not a recap of what was just done.

When Eng. Mathias Mramba asks for something, the answer is the finished product — not a plan. Tests included. Evals included. Docs included.

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, invoke it via the Skill tool. When in doubt, invoke the skill.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas/brainstorming → invoke /office-hours
- Strategy/scope → invoke /plan-ceo-review
- Architecture → invoke /plan-eng-review
- Design system/plan review → invoke /design-consultation or /plan-design-review
- Full review pipeline → invoke /autoplan
- Bugs/errors → invoke /investigate
- QA/testing site behavior → invoke /qa or /qa-only
- Code review/diff check → invoke /review
- Visual polish → invoke /design-review
- Ship/deploy/PR → invoke /ship or /land-and-deploy
- Save progress → invoke /context-save
- Resume context → invoke /context-restore
- Author a backlog-ready spec/issue → invoke /spec

## GBrain Search Guidance (configured by /sync-gbrain)
<!-- gstack-gbrain-search-guidance:start -->

GBrain is set up and synced on this machine. The agent should prefer gbrain
over Grep when the question is semantic or when you don't know the exact
identifier yet.

**This worktree is pinned to a worktree-scoped code source** via the
`.gbrain-source` file in the repo root (kubectl-style context).
`gbrain code-def`, `code-refs`, `code-callers`, `code-callees`, `search`, and
`query` from anywhere under this worktree route to that source by default —
no `--source` flag needed (gbrain >= 0.41.38.0; on older gbrain the call-graph
commands need `--source "$(cat .gbrain-source)"`). Conductor sibling worktrees
of the same repo each have their own pin and their own indexed pages, so
semantic results match the code on disk here.

Call-graph queries (`code-callers`/`code-callees`) also need the graph to be
built first — run `/sync-gbrain --dream` (or `--full`) if they return
`count: 0`. This only works if this source's gbrain schema pack extracts code
symbols; on a non-code-aware pack `--dream` completes but the graph stays empty
and reports a WARN. `code-def`/`code-refs` need the same extraction.

Two indexed corpora available via the `gbrain` CLI:
- This worktree's code (auto-pinned via `.gbrain-source`).
- `~/.gstack/` curated memory (registered as `gstack-brain-<user>` source via
  the existing federation pipeline).

Prefer gbrain when:
- "Where is X handled?" / semantic intent, no exact string yet:
    `gbrain search "<terms>"` or `gbrain query "<question>"`
- "Where is symbol Y defined?" / symbol-based code questions:
    `gbrain code-def <symbol>` or `gbrain code-refs <symbol>`
- "What calls Y?" / "What does Y depend on?":
    `gbrain code-callers <symbol>` / `gbrain code-callees <symbol>`
- "What did we decide last time?" / past plans, retros, learnings:
    `gbrain search "<terms>" --source gstack-brain-<user>`

Grep is still right for known exact strings, regex, multiline patterns, and
file globs. Run `/sync-gbrain` after meaningful code changes; for ongoing
auto-sync across all worktrees, run `gbrain autopilot --install` once per
machine — gbrain's daemon handles incremental refresh on a schedule.

Safety: don't run `/sync-gbrain` while `gbrain autopilot` is active — the
orchestrator refuses destructive source ops when it detects a running autopilot
to avoid racing it (#1734). Prefer registering user repos with `gbrain sources
add --path <dir>` (no `--url`): URL-managed sources can auto-reclone, and the
sync code walk for them requires an explicit `--allow-reclone` opt-in.

## Deploy Configuration (configured by /setup-deploy)
- Platform: Custom — self-hosted on a shared Contabo VPS (root@13.140.137.243), alongside other unrelated sites (kujuana.com, kujuatime.com, betyoyote.com, etc.). No dedicated CI/CD yet — deploys are manual over SSH.
- Production URL: https://salimcyrus.com (DNS repointed 2026-09-02 from GitHub Pages to 13.140.137.243; www redirects to apex)
- App location on server: `/opt/salimcyrus` (git clone of this repo's `main` branch)
- Process manager: PM2, process name `salimcyrus`, `npm start` (Next.js), local port 3014, `NODE_ENV=production`
- Reverse proxy: nginx vhost at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/salimcyrus` (symlinked in sites-enabled), proxies `salimcyrus.com`/`www.salimcyrus.com` → `127.0.0.1:3014`, HTTP→HTTPS redirect, www→apex redirect
- TLS: Let's Encrypt via certbot, cert at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/salimcyrus.com/`
- Database: dedicated PostgreSQL 16 database `salimcyrus` (role `salimcyrus`) on the server's native Postgres at `127.0.0.1:5432` — separate from every other site's database on that box. `DATABASE_URL` lives in `/opt/salimcyrus/.env` (Prisma convention, not committed). Migrations applied via `npx prisma migrate deploy`.
- Runtime secrets: `/opt/salimcyrus/.env.local` (not committed) — `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` generated and set; `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `PESAPAL_CONSUMER_KEY`, `WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_*`, `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID` are still blank pending real production credentials from Eng. Mathias Mramba — payments/email are degraded until those are filled in (see README's Payments section for what still works without them).
- Deploy workflow: none automated. `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` / `deploy-staging.yml` exist locally but are placeholders (`# TODO: wire up actual deploy target`) and can't be pushed yet — the GitHub CLI auth token lacks the `workflow` scope (`gh auth refresh -s workflow` needed, must be run by Eng. Mathias Mramba).
- Merge method: direct push to `main` (no branch protection configured)
- Project type: web app (Next.js 14, Prisma/PostgreSQL)
- Post-deploy health check: `curl -sI https://salimcyrus.com` (expect `HTTP/2 200`)

### Manual deploy steps (until CI/CD is wired up)
```bash
ssh root@13.140.137.243
cd /opt/salimcyrus
git pull origin main
npm ci
npx prisma migrate deploy
npm run build
pm2 restart salimcyrus
```

### Known environment quirks on this server
- `git clone`/`pull` over HTTPS to github.com fails with `fatal: could not read Username ... expected flush after ref listing` unless HTTP/1.1 is forced — this server's network path mangles git's HTTP/2 framing. Fixed globally via `git config --global http.version HTTP/1.1` (already set on this server for the root user).
- This Postgres 16 cluster has no `template1` (pre-existing condition, not caused by this deploy) — `CREATE DATABASE` must specify `TEMPLATE template0` explicitly.
- Port 3014 was chosen because 3000-3002, 3004, 3009, 3013, 4000 are already in use by other sites on this box — check `ss -tlnp` before reusing a port.
